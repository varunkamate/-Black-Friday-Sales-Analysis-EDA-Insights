🛒 Black Friday Sales Analysis —
EDA & Insights This project is my hands-on attempt at exploring Black Friday sales data using Python. I wanted to see how factors like Age, Gender, City, and Product Categories affect customer purchase behavior.

📂 Project Files
train.csv → The dataset containing anonymized customer info, product categories, and purchase amounts.

train.ipynb → My Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step EDA, visualizations, and insights.

🔍 What I Did
Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.

Explored relationships between demographics and purchase amount.

Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to create meaningful visualizations.

Highlighted patterns in product preferences across different age groups and cities.

📊 Skills & Libraries Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Data Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib

EDA techniques: GroupBy, Value Counts, Correlation, Barplots

💡 Key Insights (Spoiler!)
Younger age groups tend to purchase more in certain product categories.

Purchase behavior varies significantly across city categories.

Some product categories dominate across all demographics.
